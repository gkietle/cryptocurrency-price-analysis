## Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for a class project on forecasting cryptocurrency prices using statistical models and machine learning algorithms. The project explores the performance of Linear Regression, ARIMAX, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Vector Autoregression (VAR), XGBoost, and LightGBM in forecasting the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is collected from finance.yahoo.com, containing daily data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin from 2018-03-01 to 2024-06-01. The dataset includes features such as open price, high price, low price, close price, adjusted close price, and trading volume.

## Feature Engineering
To improve the predictive performance of the models, the project incorporates technical indicators as features. These indicators, such as moving averages and momentum indicators, provide insights into market sentiment and trends, aiding in the prediction of price movements.

## Models
The following models are implemented and evaluated in this project:

- [Linear Regression](./Models/LinearRegression/)
- [ARIMAX](./Models/ARIMAX/)
- [Vector Autoregression (VAR)](./Models/VAR/)
- [Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)](./Models/RNN/)
- [Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)](./Models/GRU/)
- [Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](./Models/LSTM/)
- [XGBoost](./Models/XGBoost/)
- [LightGBM](./Models/LightGBM/)

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated using various performance metrics, such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Three different train-test split ratios are used for each model: 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10. The results are compared to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each model in accurately predicting cryptocurrency prices.

## Executive Summary
This project explores cryptocurrency price prediction using statistical and machine learning models, focusing on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE). A dataset from 2018â€“2024 was analyzed, incorporating technical indicators like MACD, Moving Averages, and Bollinger Bands.

Eight modelsâ€”Linear Regression, ARIMAX, VAR, RNN, GRU, LSTM, XGBoost, and LightGBMâ€”were evaluated. GRU achieved the lowest RMSE (1,143 for BTC, 0.0067 for DOGE) and MAPE (1.96% for BTC, 5.50% for DOGE) in most scenarios. LSTM excelled in ETH prediction, with an RMSE of 79.93 and MAPE of 2.56%.

These results indicate GRU and LSTM's superior capability to capture complex patterns in cryptocurrency prices. Future work will focus on hybrid models and additional technical indicators to further improve prediction accuracy and robustness.


Below are the detailed results of the models for detail visualization of each model's performance, please refer to this [directory](./Latex/visualize/) for more details.
